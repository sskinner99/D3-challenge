          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <hr>
          <h6>By selecting different axes in the above chart, you can compare data types to get the values used for the analysis below:</h6>
          <hr>
          <h3>Poverty vs.</h3>
          <p>As poverty increases, there is a resulting increase in the lack of healthcare. The rates of obesity decrease in comparison, as poverty increases.
            Both of these factors could be related to the availability of food and healthcare to the impoverished. However, smoking rates remain stable regardless
            of poverty levels which indicates that even those living in povertiy are spending money on smoking. This doesn't take into account the rates or amount
            smoked, which could differ based on poverty levels.
          </p>
          <h3>Age vs.</h3>
          <p>As age increases there is a trend towards decrease in healthcare and obesity, but increase in smoking. These trends aren't profound and further data would
            need to be collected to show how strong the correlation is. Note that the median ages of this data set are between 28 and 38. With a 10 year median age 
            difference, there may not be enough of a disparity to show a large or strong trend in these comparisons. Further data should be used among a wider array of
            age groups to compare these values.
          </p>
          <h3>Income vs.</h3>
          <p>As Income increases, fewer members of the population lack healthcare. Along with this, obesity levels decrease on average as income increases.
            However, smokers do not show a direct correlation to income. While there is greater disparity between data points as income increases, the median
            percentage of smokers remains similar. Location and environmental factors due to state differences may play a role in these values as well - that
            is something that should be looked into for the future.
